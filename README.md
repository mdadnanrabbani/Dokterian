**🩺 Dokterian – Flutter UI Implementation**

Dokterian is a Flutter UI project created as a practice-based implementation of a Figma design by UI Designer: Lokanaka.
The goal of this project is to convert a real-world mobile UI design into a pixel-perfect Flutter interface using core layout and UI widgets.

This project focuses on mastering Flutter UI building concepts such as:

- Row
- Column
- Stack
- Container
- CircleAvatar

Custom layout alignment & spacing
and building a visually clean and responsive mobile interface.

**Purpose of this Project**

**This project is built for**:

- Practising Figma to Flutter UI conversion
- Improving layout thinking and widget structuring
- Understanding real-world UI composition
- Building a strong UI portfolio for Flutter development

It is not a functional medical app — it is a UI-only Flutter project meant for learning and showcasing layout skills.
